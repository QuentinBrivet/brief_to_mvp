# Your rule content

- Use /v1/agents/completions endpoint when interacting with a Mistral agent.

The request body must include:

"agent_id" — the agent's unique ID string

"messages" — a list of objects { role: 'user'|'system'|'assistant', content: string }

Do NOT include model — agents define their model internally.

Do not include unsupported fields (e.g. agent_id on /chat/completions, or id inside messages).

Always use application/json content-type.

Route requests through /api/mistral — Vite proxy handles API key securely.

Maintain Axios error handling — catch 422s, 401s, 500s and wrap them in structured messages.

The frontend must never require the user to enter or manage the API key.

Do not change the data flow or logic — UX/UI only

Don’t add libraries unless needed (use Tailwind, framer-motion, or pure CSS)

Keep full theme compatibility with light/dark mode (theme.css)

Respect isLoading from App state to trigger loading UI
